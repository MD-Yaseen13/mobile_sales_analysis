## Overview

Welcome to the **Mobile Sales Analysis** project! This project is part of my 30-day data science challenge, inspired by Flipkart’s annual shopping extravaganza, **“The Big Billion Days”**. During this event, high-end and mid-range mobiles drop drastically in price for a limited number of days. In this project, I analyzed mobile sales data from Flipkart to uncover trends and insights into customer buying behavior in India.
